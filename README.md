# Welcome to DDLC Online!

DDLC Online is a mod that makes DDLC... multiplayer. This README is placeholder. I refuse to explain anything further for now.

# Server Setup
One again, placeholder, but the IP in config.ini is supposed to be a local machine IP(which you can get via IPCONFIG)
You also likely need Python 3.9 to run it.
